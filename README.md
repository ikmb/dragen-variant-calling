# Dragen Variant Calling Pipeline

This pipeline is used at the IKMB/CCGA to automatically run samples through the Dragen variant calling process.

It currently supports both single-sample calling as well as joint-calling of cohorts. Calls can be generated both
against hg38HD as well as hg19, for genomes or exomes. For more details, see the documentation below.
